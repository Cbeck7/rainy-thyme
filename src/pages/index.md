      Animal Facts was created in 2020 during the 8.3 patch of BFA shudders. We
      started pugging raiders and were able to complete 6 of 12 in Nyalotha
      before the Shadowlands pre-patch and 12 0f 12 after. Now with the hype of
      Shadowlands we have a 25 man raid group that is 6 of 10 in normal Castle
      Nathria! Raid times are 7-9:30 PM PST
