      Ready for your first animal fact? Most elephants weigh less than the
      tongue of a blue whale. Isn't that Amazing?! Almost as amazing as our
      little guild, we are a small group of casual heroic progression raiders
      who love to have fun.

      Animal Facts was created in 2020 during the 8.3 patch of BFA shudders. We
      started pugging raiders and were able to complete 6 of 12 in Nyalotha
      before the Shadowlands pre-patch and 12 0f 12 after. Now with the hype of
      Shadowlands we have a 25 man raid group that is 6 of 10 in normal Castle
      Nathria! Raid times are 7-9:30 PM PST
